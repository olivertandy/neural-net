# neuralnet

A simple feed-forward neural network that is trained using a genetic algorithm to produce the same behaviour as an XOR gate. The 'Perceptron' class is expandable to include more input, output and hidden nodes.

## Interaction

Once the genetic optimisation has run, a graphical representation of the network is displayed. A node's level of activation is mapped to its grayscale value, with 0 mapped to black and 1 mapped to white. The input nodes can be clicked to toggle between activations of 1 and 0 and the resulting behaviour observed in the output node.
